# Scoring
The Python script 'score.py' recreates how organizers will score user-generated routes against driver-taken routes during the competition's scoring phase. This allows users to check the performance of their in-progress models on their own machines and incorporate the logic into their models.

# Scoring Logic
The scoring function below calculates the similarity between the true driver-taken sequence and a user-submitted sequence. It combines elements of Sequence Deviation and Edit Distance with Real Penalty. The score of each user-submitted route is defined as follows:

$$score = \frac{SD(A,B) \cdot {ERP}_{norm}(A,B)}{{ERP}_e(A,B)}$$

where sequence $$A$$ is the historically realized sequence of deliveries, sequence $$B$$ is the algorithm-produced sequence of deliveries, $$SD$$ denotes the Sequence Deviation of $$B$$ with respect to $$A$$, $$ERP_{norm}$$ denotes the Edit Distance with Real Penalty applied to sequences $$A$$ and $$B$$ with normalized travel costs, and $${ERP}_e$$ denotes the number of edits done by the $$ERP$$ algorithm on sequence $$B$$ with respect to $$A$$. 

If a user-submitted route is deemed invalid -- meaning it does not provide a valid of sequence that contains the station and all stops -- the route is given a score equivalent to a typical complete random perturbation of the driver-taken sequence. 

# 'Evaluate Function'
To incorporate the scoring logic into your own models, call the function 'evaluate' located within the score.py script and provide it the following inputs:

## Inputs
- actual_routes_json: the filepath of the JSON object that contains the sequence of historically-realized stops in the route, given as a string
- submission_json: the filepath of the JSON object that contains the sequence of stops generated by the user's model, given as a string
- cost_matrices_json: the filepath of the JSON object that contains the transit times between each stop in the route, given as a string
- invalid_scores_json: the filepath of the JSON object that contains the score assigned to the user-submitted route if it is deemed invalid, given as a string

All JSON files above may contain the necessary information corresponding to one or more routes.
